# Flight Reservation System - React Setup Instructions

This guide assumes you are starting with a clean installation on your machine and will cover the steps to install Node.js (which includes `npm`), `npx`, and create a new React application using the `create-react-app` utility.

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Before you can create a React application, you need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), which come together in the Node.js installation.

1. Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the installer for the LTS (Long-Term Support) version.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and npm.

## Step 2: Verify Installation

Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Step 3: Create React Application

Now that Node.js and npm are installed, you can create your React application.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to where you want your project to reside.
3. Use the npx command to create a new React application.

```bash
npx create-react-app frontend
```

## Step 4: Create React Application

Navigate into your new React application directory and start the development server.

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
