### Collaboration Workflow

- Always pull the latest changes from the remote repository before starting work.
- Create a new branch for dangerous feature or bug fix.
- Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages.
- Maintain an up-to-date README.md with project setup instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- Use a consistent coding style and enforce it with linters and formatters like ESLint and Prettier.
