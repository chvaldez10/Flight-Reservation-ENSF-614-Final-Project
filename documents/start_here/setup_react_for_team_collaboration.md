# React Application Setup for Team Collaboration

This document outlines the process for setting up a React application in a team environment. It covers the initial setup by one team member and the subsequent steps for other team members to get started with the project.

## Prerequisites

- **Git:** All team members should have Git installed on their systems. Git will be used for version control and collaboration.
- **Node.js and npm:** Ensure Node.js is installed. It includes `npm`, which is needed to install dependencies and run the React app.

## Initial Setup by One Team Member

Only one team member needs to perform the initial setup and commit the boilerplate React app to the shared repository.

### 1. Create React App

Create a new React application using the `create-react-app` utility.

```bash
npx create-react-app <app-name>
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the remote repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <remote-repository-url>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm start
```
